# comfy

Some comfortable clojure(script) utils with no dependencies.

Part general-purpose functions and macros, part syntax sugar.

It reflects my personal preferences, hopefully fairly tastefully chosen.

Starting at version one-point-oh, I won't change the meaning of stuff,
preferring to introduce [new names and deprecating (but not deleting) old ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk).
Accretion, not breakage.

## Rationale

There already exists a bunch of these util libraries for clojure.

Here's an incomplete list of them:

* [detritus](https://github.com/arrdem/detritus)
* [encore](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore)
* [medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley)
* [plumbing](https://github.com/plumatic/plumbing)
* [suchwow](https://github.com/marick/suchwow)
* [useful](https://github.com/flatland/useful)
* [tupelo](https://github.com/cloojure/tupelo)

So why another one? Well, a lot of it is convenience. This one is mine,
I can add whatever I need to it and cut releases whenever I feel like it.

I can choose not to break anything, unlike detritus which says in it's readme
"breaking changes will be frequent". Which is totally fine as long as it's
honest about it (as it is), but I want something
that I can just mindlessly upgrade without thinking.

Also, importantly, no deps. Of the above libraries, I think only medley
and detritus have no dependencies.

I tend to add this lib and [medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley)
straight away to any new projects. One of them always seem to come in handy.
medley has both the qualities that I described above;
it probably won't ever break anything and has no dependencies.

I have re-implemented or independently invented a lot of stuff that already
exists in other libs, but won't add anything that's already in medley.

## Usage

Requires a clojure version >= 1.9.0-alpha16
and/or a clojurescript version >= 1.9.542

Add this to your `:dependencies`

```clojure
[madstap/comfy "1.0.0"]
```

Require like this:

```
(ns foo.core
 (:require
  [madstap.comfy :as comfy]))
```

In cljs `:require-macros` is not needed.

Functions with `:no-doc` metadata are considered implementation
details, and subject to change, as is anything in the
`madstap.comfy.alpha` namespace. The alpha namespace in particular is a
free-for-all where nothing is guaranteed to stay the same or even stay at all.

If you find yourself using anything from
either, open an issue and I'll consider making it permanent.
(Or you could just copy and paste the implementation.)

## Things it has

##### `prewalk-reduce`, `prewalk-transduce`, `postwalk-reduce` and `postwalk-transduce`

Exactly what it says on the tin; reduce and transduce versions of the functions in `clojure.walk`.

##### `deep-merge` and `deep-merge-with`

Pretty self explanatory, they appear in a lot of places and now here as well.

One thing I've done differently to some other implementations is that a nested
`nil` is treated as an empty map, like with `merge` proper.

A use-case I've found is to merge attr maps in hiccup,
where there might be a `:style` key that has a nested map.

##### `group-by` as a transducing context

Sometimes when I use `group-by`, I also want to transform the values
as they're added to the vector at each key. Accepting a transducer
affords great flexibility in how to transform the items as they're added to the vector.
It's also more performant than doing something like `medley/map-vals` afterwards.

A new instance of the reducing function is created for each key,
with it's own state, if any.

```clojure
;; The use-case that made me write this is when comforming a spec.
(s/def ::foos (s/* (s/or :int int? :str string?)))

(->> [1 2 "foo" "bar" 3]
     (s/conform ::foos)
     (comfy/group-by key (map val))) ;;=> {:int [1 2 3], :str ["foo" "bar"]}
```

It can also take a reducing function and a(n) (optional) init value, in which case
it acts like `transduce`.

```clojure
(group-by odd? (map char) str (range 97 (inc 122)))
;;=> {true "acegikmoqsuwy", false "bdfhjlnprtvxz"}
```

##### `keep` and `run!` with multiple collections arity

I found the fact that the core versions can only take one collection quite surprising,
so I made versions without that limitation. When passed multiple collections,
they behave like map.

##### `forcat`, `forv`, `for-map` and other variations on `for`

`forcat` is to `for` like `mapcat` is to `map`. Similarly `forv` => `mapv`.

`for-map` creates a map, and takes a key and a value expression as the body.

##### `defs`

It's `def`, but with destructuring. Quite handy at the repl, may be useful in actual code.

##### But wait, there's more!
