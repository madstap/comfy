# comfy

Some comfortable clojure(script) utils.

Similar to [medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley)
in that it tries to be fairly lightweight and focused,
with a small set of general-purpose functions and macros.

## Usage

comfy leverages spec, and requires a clojure version >= 1.9.0-alpha16
and/or a clojurescript version >= 1.9.542

Add this to your `:dependencies`

```clojure
[madstap/comfy "0.1.1"]]
```

Require like this:

```
(ns foo.core
 (:require
  [madstap.comfy.core :as comfy]))
```

In cljs there's no need to `:require-macros`, as comfy enables macro-inference.

### [api docs](https://madstap.github.io/comfy/madstap.comfy.core.html)

Some of the more interesting things in comfy are:

#### `deep-merge` and `deep-merge-with`

Pretty self explanatory, they appear in a lot of places and now here as well.

One thing I've done differently to some other implementations is that a nested
`nil` is treated as an empty map, like with `merge` proper.

A use-case I've found is to merge attr maps in hiccup,
where there might be a `:style` key that has a nested map.

#### `group-by`

Sometimes when I use `group-by`, I also want to transform the values
as they're added to the vector at each key. Accepting a transducer
affords great flexibility in how to transform the items as they're added to the vector.
It's also more performant than doing something like `medley/map-vals` afterwards.

A new instance of the reducing function is created for each key,
with it's own state, if any.

```clojure
;; The use-case that made me write this is when comforming a spec.
(s/def ::foos (s/* (s/or :int int? :str string?)))

(->> [1 2 "foo" "bar" 3]
     (s/conform ::foos)
     (comfy/group-by key (map val))) ;;=> {:int [1 2 3], :str ["foo" "bar"]}
```

#### `keep` and `run!`

I found the fact that the core versions can only take one collection quite surprising,
so I made versions without that limitation. When passed multiple collections,
they behave like map.
