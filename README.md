# comfy

Some comfortable clojure utils. Similar to [medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley)
in that it tries to be fairly lightweight,
with a small set of general-purpose functions and macros.

## Usage

comfy requires a clojure version >= 1.9.0-alpha16
and/or a clojurescript version >= 1.9.542

Add this to your `:dependencies`

```clojure
[madstap/comfy "0.1.0"]]
```

Require like this:

```
(ns foo.core
 (:require
  [madstap.comfy.core :as comfy]))
```
